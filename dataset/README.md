# Dataset Status

This repository is under active development.

## Current Status
- Dataset images are being collected from real-world usage using a Raspberry Pi camera.
- Annotation is being performed using CVAT and Roboflow.
- Labels will follow YOLOv8 format.

## Note
Due to time constraints during application submission, annotated images are not yet uploaded.
The dataset and trained YOLOv8 model will be added shortly.

## Planned Uploads
- Annotated training and validation images
- YOLOv8-compatible labels
- Trained model weights
- Inference and evaluation scripts
